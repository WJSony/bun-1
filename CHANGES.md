Change log for Bun
=====================

Version 0.0.4
-------------

Use `antiformat` in certain places to guard against incoming strings that may have single `{` and/or `}` characters. The latter causes errors when they're passed to Python's string `format`.


Version 0.0.3
-------------

Renamed this project **Bun** to avoid a PyPI project name collision with the former name, Quiche.


Version 0.0.2
-------------

Add basic GUI code originally developed for other programs.  It is almost functional.


Version 0.0.1
-------------

First release.
