Icon sources for Sidetrack
==========================

The [vector artwork](https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=quiche&i=1529315) of a quiche, used as the icon for this repository, was created by [Made by Made, AU](https://thenounproject.com/made.somewhere/) from the Noun Project.  It is licensed under the Creative Commons [CC-BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) license.

I edited the logo in [Boxy SVG](https://boxy-svg.com), a native SVG editor for macOS to change the icon color to the orange used by Caltech in their logo.
